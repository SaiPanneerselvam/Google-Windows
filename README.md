# Google-Windows
Google Windows is just Microsoft Windows 10*, but every process is replaced with a google-owned version of it.
######
Google Windows COMPLETELY REPLACES the Microsoft Edge browser and tries to delete any other microsoft product that could be optional. Below is a table of what was replaced with what.

|Application  | What it was replaced with |
|--|--|
| Microsoft Edge | Google Chrome |
| Microsoft OneDrive | Google Drive |
| Microsoft Word | Google Docs |
| Microsoft Powerpoint | Google Slides |
| Microsoft Excel | Google Sheets |
| Paint (not fully removed) | Google Drawings |
| Microsoft Outlook or Mail | Gmail |
